# Machine-Learning
Machine Learning course from Stanford University

- the repo will contain the coding asssignments provided by the course

## Exercise 1 - Week 2
Univariate and multivariate **Linear Regression** using *Gradient Descent*

## Exercise 2 - Week 3
**Logistic Regression** - the basic and the regularised variants

## Exercise 3 - Week 4
Still **Logistic Regression**, but regularised and also *forward propagation*
for **Neural Networks**

## Exercise 4 - Week 5
Both *forward propagation* and *backpropagation* for the same **Neural Netowrk** as before
