# Exercise 5 - Bias vs Variance
The asssignment is based ariund plotting different hypotheses in order to showcase the phoenomena
of *underfitting* and *overfitting*.

Furthermore, *regularisation* is also implemented with different parameters *lambda* in order to
observe the differences in performnce on the *cross-validation* set.

Due to the linear hypothesis underfitting the data, a new model which outputs a *polynomial
hypothesis* is trained, in order to get a steeper *learning curve*.
